# daiker, a teeny-tiny virtual machine tool

Unlike Docker, daiker doesn't need any special privilege.

Unlike Singularity, daiker is a full machine level virtualizatione just like a real machine. You can even run Windows on it

## Prerequisites
```
$ lsmod |grep kvm #verify kvm kernel module
$ which qemu-system-x86_64 #verify if qemu is installed
```

## Installation
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/daiker/master/daiker
$ chmod +x daiker
$ mv daiker ~/bin/ # or move to any directory in your PATH
```

## Test steps, [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_ql6Mptmo&list=PLcUreuc9RezIrppGh-AEYfV-FOdcE5RHY)

1. build a base image, here we use Alpine Linux as an example
```
$ wget http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.12.1-x86_64.iso
$ daiker build -i alpine-standard-3.12.1-x86_64.iso alpine-base.img 
```
2. inside the new machine, type root to login, run 'setup-alpine' to install Alpine, then run 'poweroff'

3. create a few new virtual machines
```
$ daiker run -b alpine-base.img test1.img 
$ daiker run -b alpine-base.img test2.img 
```
4. boot the new machine if it was poweroff
```
$ daiker run test1.img  
$ daiker run -T 22 test1.img #forward a random port on physical machine to port 22 on the virtual machine
```

## Help
```
$ daiker -h
```
append '-v' to any sub-commands to check out the backend qemu commands

## Roadmp
One more interesting feature is planned indeed, please check back later.
