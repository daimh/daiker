# daiker, a teeny-tiny but potent virtual machine tool

Unlike Docker, daiker doesn't need any special privilege. A regular Linux account with or without X is enough.

Unlike Singularity, daiker is a full virtualization just like a real machine. You can even run Windows on it.

## Prerequisites
```
lsmod |grep kvm #verify kvm kernel module
which qemu-system-x86_64 #verify if qemu is installed
```

## Installation
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/daiker/master/daiker
chmod +x daiker
mv daiker ~/bin/ # or any directory in PATH
```

## Examples
This example shows daiker automatically install Linux virtual machines without either user interaction or root privilege. CentOS 7 and OpenSUSE 15.3 were tested on 2022-01-04.
```
cd examples
make
cd var
daiker run -b centos-base.qcow2 centos-test.qcow2 
daiker run -b opensuse-base.qcow2 opensuse-test.qcow2 
```

## Test steps. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_ql6Mptmo&list=PLcUreuc9RezIrppGh-AEYfV-FOdcE5RHY)

1. build a base image, here we use Alpine Linux as an example
```
wget http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.12.1-x86_64.iso
daiker build -i alpine-standard-3.12.1-x86_64.iso alpine-base.qcow2 
# #inside the guest machine
# setup-alpine
# poweroff
```
2. create a few new guest machines
```
daiker run -b alpine-base.qcow2 test1.qcow2 
daiker run -b alpine-base.qcow2 test2.qcow2 
```
3. boot the new machine if it was poweroff
```
daiker run test1.qcow2 
```

## Advanced usage
* allow outside to access SSH service on a guest machine. [Video](https://youtu.be/lhzlTCWviHo)
```
daiker run -T 22 test1.qcow2
```
* mount a directory on the host to the guest machine
```
daiker run -M /tmp test1.qcow2 
# #inside the guest machine
# mount -t 9p daiker-0 /mnt
```
* build a cluster of guest machines that can talk to each other. [Video](https://youtu.be/nuahSihAbno)
```
daiker run -P test1.qcow2
daiker run -P test2.qcow2 
# #inside guest machine test1
# ip l set eth1 up
# ip a a 192.168.8.1/24 dev eth1
# ping 192.168.8.2
# #inside guest machine test2
# ip l set eth1 up
# ip a a 192.168.8.2/24 dev eth1
```
* attach a block device to the host
```
cat /proc/partitions # please make sure it is the right device!!! Assume it is /dev/sdz in the commands below
sudo chown -R $USER /dev/sdz
daiker run -Q "-drive file=/dev/sdz,format=raw" windows.qcow2
```

## Help
```
daiker -h
```
append '-v' to any sub-commands to check out the backend qemu commands
